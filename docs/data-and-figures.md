# Results, data and figure index

The sole active development plan is [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md). The result
below is completed development evidence; future claim-specific benchmark gates
are recorded in that roadmap.

## Current evidence-sufficiency result

| Artifact | Meaning | Reproduction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Specification](../studies/evidence_sufficiency/spec.json) | Single home for dimensions, loading, perturbations, comparison tolerances and acquisition costs | Inputs to the runner |
| [Numeric result](../reports/evidence-sufficiency/results.json) | Full development outcome matrix, truth, source hashes, policy and per-configuration scores | `python -m studies.evidence_sufficiency.run` |
| [Tables](../reports/evidence-sufficiency/matrix.md), [outcome CSV](../reports/evidence-sufficiency/outcomes.csv), [policy CSV](../reports/evidence-sufficiency/policies.csv) | Values and checks separated by loading, followed by counts and coverage/cost; CSVs retain full precision | Same command |
| [PNG](../reports/evidence-sufficiency/boundary-condition.png), [SVG](../reports/evidence-sufficiency/boundary-condition.svg) | Control and half-modulus stress [MPa], extension [mm] and reaction [N], with observable check outcomes | `python -m studies.evidence_sufficiency.plot` with matplotlib installed |
| [FEA table](../reports/fea-interpretation.md), [numeric interpretation](../reports/fea-interpretation.json) | Completion, correlation agreement and convergence separated, with original record hashes | `python -m cadloop.fea.interpret` |

The figure is a verification example, not physical validation. Configuration
and source provenance are linked above; no decorative or generated artwork is
used. The table and figure derive their numbers from the executed matrix.
[Protocol and derivation](../studies/evidence_sufficiency/README.md) explain the
independent reference and what selectors can observe.

## Claim-specific development result

The M1.1 [claim contract](../studies/evidence_sufficiency/claims/spec.json) adds
explicit observables, units, agreement and evidence tolerances, loading
conventions, assumptions and allowed implementation explanations. It reuses the
foundation's dimensions and loads. The
[numeric result](../reports/claim-sufficiency/results.json) is the source for the
[generated table](../reports/claim-sufficiency/matrix.md), separating artifact
correctness from claim-specific evidence sufficiency. Regenerate both with:

```bash
python -m studies.evidence_sufficiency.claims.run
```

The [derivation and reproduction notes](../studies/evidence_sufficiency/claims/README.md)
explain the finite explanation boundary and retained-row hashes. A table keeps
the compatible explanations and opposite decisions directly comparable; no
additional figure is needed. The full-tuple result and its figure above remain
unchanged by M1.1.

## Preserved calculation-verifier benchmark

[benchmark-results.md](../reports/benchmark-results.md) is the numeric result
home for the earlier annotated-case evaluator. Reproduce without changing the
committed historical report:

```bash
engineering-audit eval benchmark/ --report /tmp/engineering-audit-benchmark.md
pytest
```

For a complete case, `passed` means detected failure modes match annotations.
A correctly detected faulty answer is therefore a benchmark PASS. It does not
mean the answer itself was correct. Pending capture cases remain excluded.
The challenge-protocol captures are elicited outputs; they do not establish
wild-usage performance. See [provenance](capture_provenance.md),
[schema](schema_contract.md), and [limitations](../LIMITATIONS.md).

[History](history/README.md) indexes original captures, dated CAD/FEA records,
old figures at their stable paths and removed schedules through Git history.
The previous pipeline diagram was removed from the current README because it
described the earlier evaluator question; its source remains in Git history.
[Figure manifest](figure-manifest.json) records the active figure and historical
visualizations. There is no manuscript in this repository; current claims are
in README, ROADMAP, LIMITATIONS and the linked result documentation.

## Visual design and retained views

The scientific reference is the enclosure repository at
[`bad572fc0902437445a5446bb5bc43098cc6211f`](https://github.com/500ft/sensor-enclosure-thermal-design/tree/bad572fc0902437445a5446bb5bc43098cc6211f):
[thermal bias](https://github.com/500ft/sensor-enclosure-thermal-design/blob/bad572fc0902437445a5446bb5bc43098cc6211f/analysis/figures/thermal_bias.png),
[transient prediction](https://github.com/500ft/sensor-enclosure-thermal-design/blob/bad572fc0902437445a5446bb5bc43098cc6211f/analysis/figures/thermal_transient_prediction.png)
and [generator](https://github.com/500ft/sensor-enclosure-thermal-design/blob/bad572fc0902437445a5446bb5bc43098cc6211f/analysis/thermal_bias.py).
The supplied files were hash-verified and inspected. The local design uses its
white background, coordinated panels, blue/red series, explicit units and
restrained grid. Circle/square markers and direct check labels provide color
redundancy. Zero and specification references remain visible. Each observable
has its own axis and a shared range across loading conventions; there are no
error bars or dual axes. SVG text remains editable.

On 2026-10-09 the owner asked for one figure pass across the 500ft
repositories. [`studies/figure_style.py`](../studies/figure_style.py) holds the
shared rules: three type sizes by role, outward ticks, frameless legends, one
colour and marker per variant, 300-dpi PNG and SVG without timestamps. The
figure keeps the design above. Row titles state which checks detect the fault,
and the plot asserts them against the results before saving. Points carry check
outcomes only; numeric values live in the matrix table. Category names appear
once, on the bottom row.

The active matrix is split into compact Markdown tables rather than rasterized.
Numeric columns align right, controls precede faults, percentages have one
decimal and physical values retain enough decimals for the supplied cases.
Full-precision CSVs are generated views of the same numeric JSON. Blank policy
CSV decision error means no decisions; it is shown as N/A in Markdown.
The FEA table similarly distinguishes a missing within-run change from a failed
stability criterion. It preserves completion and reference agreement separately.
The claim table names the elastic modulus in its header and shows stress to one
decimal, as the development matrix does.

Historical CAD/FEA contours and the deformation animation are retained unchanged
because they are original run artifacts. They use the solver's rainbow colour
map; redrawing them needs a MAPDL rerun on the licensed host, and the nodal
fields are not committed. The legacy evaluator report stays
unchanged as the reproducible historical result; its PASS/SKIP semantics are
explained above. Existing CAD workflow diagrams and navigation tables describe
retained machinery and do not encode new scientific results. No manuscript or
frozen release artifact was restyled. The roadmap and pending decisions are
unchanged; claim-specific benchmark development remains incomplete.

## Reference qualification candidates

The [development matrix](../reports/reference-qualification/matrix.md) and
[numeric source](../reports/reference-qualification/results.json) report the
M1.2 reference cross-checks. The axial foundation is reused unchanged.
New bending and conduction controls have separate exact stiffness or
conservation solutions; independent human review remains pending.
[Contracts, sources and derivations](../studies/reference_qualification/README.md)
define their scope and output tolerances. Regenerate the new outputs with
`python -m studies.reference_qualification.run`.
